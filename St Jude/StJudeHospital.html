     <h2>Their Story</h2>
            <!--This explains the history and purpose of the cause.-->
            <p>St. Jude Children's Research Hospital does treatments on children to try to cure their cancer. St. Jude opened in February 4, 1962.  The founder, <b>Danny Thomas</b>, stated that "no child is denied treatment based on race, religion or a family's ability to pay." St. Jude doesn't want families of the children to pay a single bill. They believe that the families should make sure that their child stays alive. The survival rate of the children increased from 20% to 80%. St. Jude Hospital is located in Memphis, Tennessee. </p>

            <!--This explains how the children live everyday.-->
            <p>Children are diagnosed with cancer in the most unexpected times. But once they are diagnosed, their lives change and they have to be restricted and responsible to many things like taking their medicine.
